            <h1 class="page-title"> Dungeons :)</h1>
                <p>Dungeons are PvE raid activities in which a team of 2 to 5 players work together to defeat mobs within a procedurally generated series of rooms, ending in a boss fight. Players are rewarded based on their performance within the dungeon with Mort Skull.png Dungeoneering XP and items within chests. The rewards scale up with the difficulty of the dungeon; the more difficult missions can drop some of the strongest items in the game. Currently, the only released Dungeons are the Catacombs and its Master Mode. Two other Dungeons are hinted with a desert and forest theme.If someone starts a party for a floor and has several players without the requirement but join the floor, then the rest of the party will be left and the party leader will get to solo the floor. this is how the money making method "Frag Running" is done on The Catacombs - Floor VII.</p>
                <p>Dungeons consist of a series of connected rooms.The main goal of each Dungeon run is to unlock each door, beat The Watcher guarding the way to the boss room, and defeat the boss. Along the way, special Dungeon Mobs will spawn and attack the player. Certain Dungeon rooms will also contain special items and buffs to help players accomplish their goal.</p>

            <h3>Dungeon Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Dungeon items receive stat buffs according to the dungeon level of its user. In addition, certain items can be upgraded with Essence, which applies up to 5 stars to the item. Each star adds a 2-10% buff outside of dungeons and 10%-50% inside the dungeon. The dungeon level and star stat buffs are additive; if a player has a 20% stat buff from levels and 50% from stars, the total stat buff will be 70%. If a slayer item is converted into a dungeon item with essence, it can be used within Dungeons even if the player does not have Slayer Level requirement of that item.</p>
